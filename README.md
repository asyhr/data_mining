Data Mining Coursework
This is part of my Data Mining coursework where I do clustering and classification using KMeans, SVM, and random forest.

Classification Dataset: Data Stream 2
Data Stream 2 is the multi-dimensional video data which 
consist of two moving objects which are a car and a motorbike. 
There are two dataset of Data Stream 2 which are ‘WLA.csv’ and ‘Labels.csv’ 
which contained three features which are the width, length 
and area of the image data in pixels format and labels of the vehicle 
either 1 which represent “car” or 2 which represent “motorbike”.

Clustering Dataset: Climate DataBasel.csv
ClimateDataBasel.csv is the data that is used for clustering. 
The datasets contain 18 features and 1763 data.
